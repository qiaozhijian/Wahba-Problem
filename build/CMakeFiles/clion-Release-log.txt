CMake Warning (dev) at /home/qzj/Software/clion-2022.3.1/bin/cmake/linux/x64/share/cmake-3.24/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args`
  (PCL_POINT_CLOUD_EDITOR) does not match the name of the calling package
  (PCL).  This can lead to problems in calling code that expects
  `find_package` result variables (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain
  pattern.
